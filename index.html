			<h2>i'm liam saliba</h2>
			

			<p>currently i'm a 2nd year master of computer science student @ university of melbourne
			<p>i have a BSc (Computing and Software Systems) and DipMaths (Statistics) from unimelb (2020)
			<p>i will be doing a masters research project soon, but i am too undecisive to choose
			<p>this semester, i am studying statistical machine learning, ai planning for autonomy and research methods

		<h3>teaching</h3>
		<p>i've been an academic tutor at the university of melbourne for over two years now.
		<p>currently i'm head tutor for comp10002 (2w), and a tutor/demonstrator for comp30023 (2t, 3d)
		<p>i'm also helping <a href="https://shaananc.github.io/">shaananc</a> with dual delivery of <a
			href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_No-EgF3MD3_5xe6FK1wIMREOiVyBV3q">comp10002 lectures</a>.
		namely, figuring out how to deliver engaging lectures to a concurrently live in-person and 
		online audience. so i'm in charge of mics and cameras and answering student questions in zoom chat, and usually
		have to fix a lot of stuff while that happens.  seems like the students are enjoying it!
		<p>previously i have taught
		<ul>
			<li><b>comp10002 foundations of algorithms</b>: 20s1, 20s2, 21s1, 22s1 - c programming, fundamental
				algorithms and data structures</li>
			<li><b>comp30023 computer systems</b>: 21s2 - operating systems, network protocols (OSI, TCP/IP),
				cryptography and os security</li>
			<li><b>comp30026 models of computation</b>: 21s2 (4t) - logic, discrete math, automata (regular languages,
				cfgs, parsing), computability, haskell</li>
			<li><b>comp20005 engineering computation</b>: 21s2 (2w).</li>
			<li><b>info30006 information security and privacy</b>: 21s2 (2w)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>(21s2 is 2021 semester 2. t=tutorial, d=demonstration, w=workshop=1t1d)</p>
		<p>most classes in 2020-2021 ran online, so i had the pleasure of zoom delivery. if you were a student of mine
			during this time, get in touch!
		<p>i was invited to give a lecture about computer malware for info30006. it was a lot of fun. <a

		<p>in 2021-22, i expanded comp10002 and comp20005's online offering on grok by adding over 50 exercises from
			alistair moffat's book programming software and abstraction with c

		<h3>my stuff</h3>
		<p>there are subject notes and misc code projects on github, i'll clean that up at some point
		<p>i can be found online as exradr / lsp0 / lsproductions0. opinions are of my own and not my employers</p>

		<h3>other stuff i think people should know about</h3>
		<p>i did not make these, i just think they're cool</p>
		<p>when i'll be bothered, i'll turn some of these into links</p>
		<ul>
			<li>github copilot -- reduce the cognitive effort of coding by 50% (citation needed)
			<li>clang-format and prettier and others -- reduce the cognitive effort of code styling by 100% (just press
				CMD-S in your favourite editor)
		</ul>

	<div>
		<h3>thanks</h3>
		<p>here i get to practice gratitude to people who have taken me places
		<p>this section is a work in progress. i'll probably make this more polite by giving links and full names, etc
		<p>thanks to: shaanan & jianzhong, alistair, bach & anna, shanika, suelette & chris; friends, family, tracy</p>
		<br>
		<p>thanks for stopping by, have a nice day!</p>
